## Features
### Developed Functionalities
- Complete Rules
- CLI
- GUI
- Socket
- 2 FA (Advanced Features)
    - __Local Game:__ The client is designed so that it can run the game solo without making a
      a connection with the server.

    - __Multiple Matches:__ The server is built so that it can handle multiple matches simultaneously,
      after the creation procedure of the first game, the players who access the server are managed
      in a waiting room to create a second game and so on.

## Compilation and packaging
The jar was built with the help of Maven Shade Plugin.
Pre-compiled jar is provided below.
To compile the jar yourself, go to the root of the project and run the command:
```
mvn clean package
```
The compiled jar will be placed inside the folder ``target/`` with the name
``MoR-AM37.jar``.

### Jar
